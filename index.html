        <p class="main__section__text"> Portrait of a Lady with a Squirrel
          and a Starling is an oil-on-oak portrait completed in around
          1526–1528 by German Renaissance painter Hans Holbein the Younger.
          The subject of this portrait is believed to be Anne Lovell,
          wife of Sir Francis Lovell (d. 1551), an esquire of the body to
          Henry VIII.The evidence for this was uncovered by stained-glass
          historian David J. King while studying the windows of the church
          in East Harling, Norfolk, the Lovell family's seat. King noted
          the Lovell family's coat of arms alongside squirrels in the stained
          glass, and also that the starlings in the painting are a pun on the
          name of the village.

        <p class="main__section__text_tell">
          I sensed someone watching me as I comforted my daughter after
          a particularly traumatizing dentist appointment at the Children’s
          Hospital. I looked up and saw you staring at us from across
          the waiting lounge. I didn’t pay much attention, as I have grown
          accustomed to the curious eyes of onlookers. Our daughter was born
          7 ½ years ago and after an abrupt lack of oxygen at birth, she
          changed the course of our lives forever. Perhaps, our lives unfolded
          exactly as they were meant to — they just didn’t unfold in the way
          we had imagined or planned. I talked to my daughter, kissed her and
          hugged her. I was giving her a brief break before putting her
          through the next traumatic experience of the day the car ride home.
          Having cerebral palsy is the least of her worries but this condition
          can turn a car seat into a torture chamber.
          I stood up to gather our things, my daughter in my arms, and it was
          then that I noticed you were holding an infant. It was difficult to
          know for certain how old she was. I knew immediately, though, that
          you were one of us. I knew that only recently your life had changed
          drastically and you sat here in this Children’s Hospital wondering,
          “How did we get here?” I should have recognized that shocked stare
          because I once had it, too.
